# Installation

Currently the best way to include this package in your project is through the unity package manager. Add the package using the git URL of this repo: https://github.com/justinleemans/networking

# Quick Start

To start using this package you also need to include one of my other packages. Unfortunately Unity doesn't support dependencies through git so you will have to install the other package yourself as well. Luckily the process is pretty much the same. The package you need to include is [justinleemans/signals](https://github.com/justinleemans/signals) and the installation instructions and quick start guide can be found on the README.md on its repository.

# Contributing

Currently I have no set way for people to contribute to this project. If you have any suggestions regarding improving on this project you can make a ticket on the GitHub repository or contact me directly.
